My personal website. You can see the actual site at [rafekettler.com](http://www.rafekettler.com). I built the site using blogofile to replace my existing Wordpress blog, but I haven't chosen to deploy it yet (writing CSS is hard).

Any code snippets that are mine (marked as otherwise if that's the case) are MIT-licensed. My templates, controllers, filters, _config.py, and CSS are also covered under the MIT license. That license, for those of you who don't know, goes like this:

The posts and pages of the site are my intellectual property unless I say otherwise (e.g. I'm quoting someone, linking, or embedding a video). You can feel free to quote me or link to a post provided that you mention either rafekettler.com or Rafe Kettler. You can also reproduce anything I've written with advance consent from me (email, post comments, and  GitHub are all good places to reach me).

If you see a "bug" in a post (or perhaps in my site design), feel free to fork or open an issue.
