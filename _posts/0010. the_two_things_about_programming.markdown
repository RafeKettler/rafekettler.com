title: The Two Things About Programming
---
I Stumbled Upon this [article on The Fishbowl](http://fishbowl.pastiche.org/2007/04/15/the_two_things_about_computer_programming/) and thought it deserved a reblog. Essentially, it gives the "Two Things" that you need to know to program and design software. Here's the short:


> Computer Programming:

>    1. Every problem can be solved by breaking it up into a series of smaller problems.
>    2. The computer will always do exactly what you tell it to.

> Software Engineering:

>    1. Writing the code is the easy part. Writing it so someone else can understand it later is the important part.
>    2. Make it work, then make it elegant, then make it fast.

If you want to read the whole thing, head on over to http://fishbowl.pastiche.org/2007/04/15/the_two_things_about_computer_programming .
