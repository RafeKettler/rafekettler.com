title: Awesome Computer Science Band Name Ideas
---
For a bit of fun, I've come up with a few CS-term-based band names(some of these may be taken):

 - Reverse Polish notation
 - Brainfuck
 - The Regular Expressions
 - Map-Reduce
 - The Generators (or the Iterators)
 - Reduced Instruction Set Funk
 - C# and F#
 - Big-Endian
 - Tux

Nerd points if you know what all this is talking about. Did I miss something? Leave a comment.
