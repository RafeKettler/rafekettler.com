title: A Truly Great Python Fail
---
I saw this on [Stack Overflow](http://www.stackoverflow.com), and I almost soiled myself with how funny it is. Without any further adieu, here's the snippet:

$$code(lang=python)
def my_func(name=None):
    if name isn't None:
        # do something
$$/code
    
If [The Daily WTF](http://www.thedailywtf.com) took Python code (it has almost _never_ appeared on TDWTF), this would definitely make it, even though it's a simple mistake. Too classic.
