title: 'Magic Method Monday: Reflection'
---
Sorry for the late post, but the past week has been a bit hectic, with Christmas and all. Today, we have two magic methods: `__instancecheck__` and `__subclasscheck__`: they allow us to define custom behavior for reflection.

`__instancecheck__`

Implements `isinstance(instance, class)`. Takes arguments `self` and `instance`.

`__subclasscheck__`

Implements `issubclass(subclass, class)`. Takes arguments `self` and `subclass`.
