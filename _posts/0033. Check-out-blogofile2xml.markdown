I said in [my last post](http://www.rafekettler.com/2011/02/26/migration-to-blogofile) that I had a tough time getting my Wordpress posts converted using the existing wordpress2blogofile script provided by the good people at [blogofile](http://www.blogofile.com).

After the fact, I decided it was worth a few hours to actually write a script to convert Wordpress XML dumps to blogofile posts. It has [a GitHub repo where you can look at the code](http://www.github.com/RafeKettler/wpxml2blogofile). It may eventually end up in the blogofile repo too.

As for the technical factors, I chose to write output as similar as possible to wordpress2blogofile as possible. The post naming conventions and the sequence of YAML metadata mimic what wordpress2xml does. I chose to use lxml for HTML parsing for a few reasons:

 1. It's a dependency for blogofile, so it's likely that the script will work for the user with no extra effort
