title: 'Magic Method Monday: Mixed Mode Arithmetic'
---
This may very well be the last magic methods blog post, and it's fitting that I'll be addressing a method that I initially overlooked.

Python would be very hard to use without mixed-mode arithmetic: imagine what Python would be like if a type-conversion was necessary to add an integer to a float. In order to make our classes behave the same way, we can define a `__coerce__` method.

`__coerce__`

Method to implement mixed mode arithmetic. Takes arguments `self` and `other`. Should return `None` if type conversion is impossible. Otherwise, it should return a pair (2-tuple) of self and other, manipulated to have the same type.

That's all for now; it seems that I'll have to find another weekly series to tackle. Keep watching the magic methods guide [here](http://www.rafekettler.com/magicmethods.html).
