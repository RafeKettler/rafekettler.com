title: 'Magic Methods: Sequences Continued'
---
It came to my attention that I left out a few magic methods when I covered sequences a few months ago. I know it's not Monday, but I don't feel like waiting to tackle this, and I have a free minute now.

`__reversed__`

`__reversed__` defines behavior for when you call `reversed()` on your sequence. Takes self.

`__contains__`

`__contains` defines behavior for when we use `in` with a custom sequence, e.g. `x in y` or `x not in y`. It takes arguments self and item to test for membership. Note that this doesn't need to be defined for `in` to work with a custom sequence; the default behavior for `x in y` is to iterate over y and return True if any of the values in y are x.

That's all for today, happy holidays everyone.
