    <content type="html" xml:base="http://www.rafekettler.com/blog/2011/02/06/functional-programming-in-python-on-trial"><![CDATA[<p>Anyone who's in the know about Python knows quite a bit about what Guido likes about Python and what he doesn't. Something that he's been very clear about for a number of years is that he doesn't like some of the functional programming constructs in Python. I'm talking about lambda expressions, <code>map()</code>, <code>filter()</code>, and <code>reduce()</code>. He said in 2005 (when he was first envisioning Python 3):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>About 12 years ago, Python aquired lambda, reduce(), filter() and map(), courtesy of (I believe) a Lisp hacker who missed them and submitted working patches. But, despite the PR value, I think these features should be cut from Python 3000. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ultimately, lambda, map, and filter stayed as builtins, and reduce got moved to functools. But why all the fuss? You might want to read <a href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=98196">the BDFL's article on the matter</a>. For those who want a bit of a different perspective, read on.</p>
<h3>Indictment</h3>
<p>Arguably, the big problem with functional programming constructs like lambdas and map is that they are less readable than their counterparts. Most would argue that <code>[x for x in y if x &gt; 2]</code> is more readable than <code>filter(lambda x: x &gt; 2, y]</code>. I won't argue with that. But that's certainly an extreme example, isn't it? It just so happens that this example represents a case that works out very nicely in a list comprehension. In the spirit of due process, however, this and other affronts to readability serve as sufficient evidence to charge functional constructs in Python with a quite heinous crime in the Python userland: obfuscation.</p>
<h3>On the charges against lambdas</h3>
<p>First, lambda expressions. This is a feature that should not be used to produce any substantial routine. I think most of us can agree that this is evil:</p>
<div class="pygments_tango"><pre><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">lambda</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">functioncall</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">functioncall</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">y</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>This is bad for a number of reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>No way to write a docstring</li>
<li>No normal function declaration -- hangs up documentation tools, makes it hard to know that function x exists by reading the source</li>
<li>One-liner (in the bad way) -- there's quite a bit going on for that one line of code</li>
</ol>
<p>Rather, it should always be written in its normal form, like so:</p>
<div class="pygments_tango"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">x</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="sd">&#39;&#39;&#39;I provide useful info about the function for IDEs and docs generators.</span>
<span class="sd">    I also am good for those reading source.&#39;&#39;&#39;</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">functioncall</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">functioncall</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">b</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Wasn't that better? Clearly, lambda must be guilty of the crime of obfuscation.</p>
<p>Now to sentencing: what should we do to lambda? Many would suggest to get rid of it. I say keep it. It might be obscure and unreadable in some cases, but it's a lifesaver in cases where you need to pass a very simple callback to a function. So, in the case of <code>lambda v. Python</code>, the judge finds the defendant guilty and orders him to be placed in house arrest, only to leave when used as a simple callback.</p>
<h3>On the charges against map and filter</h3>
<p>map and filter face similar charges of obfuscation. Many would argue that powerful list comprehensions obviate the need for map and filter:</p>
<div class="pygments_tango"><pre><span class="nb">map</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">function</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">seq</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">seq</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="c"># more clear, relies on more &quot;standard&quot; language constructs</span>
<span class="nb">filter</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">function</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">seq</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">[</span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="k">for</span>  <span class="n">x</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">seq</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">)]</span> <span class="c"># likewise</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Personally, I don't find the map and filter implementations to be much less readable than their list comprehension counterparts. However, I also happen to like functional programming and I know a good bit about Python. Most people would have a hard time reading this, especially as complexity increases.</p>
<p>Along the lines of "There should be one, and only one, obvious way to do it", map and filter are guilty of crowding Python with new solutions to problems that have already been solved. In the court of Python, this is an offense punishable by death. Because of this, in the case <code>map and filter v. Python</code>, the judge finds the defendants guilty and sentences them to death. The defendants should be promptly removed from the standard library, and should only leave their places on death row for code golf competitions.</p>
<h3>reduce</h3>
<p>reduce is a fold operation, if you're familiar with other functional languages you should get this. It's a recursive concept and a common idiom in functional programming that many languages encapsulated in a higher order function (as they should have). However, Python is not a very recursive language. To demonstrate to the court why reduce is guilty, take a look at this example.</p>
<div class="pygments_tango"><pre><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">reduce</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">lambda</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">seq</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c"># what is this i don&#39;t even</span>

<p><span class="c"># equivalent in human speak</span>
<span class="n">product</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">seq</span><span class="p">:</span>
     <span class="n">product</span> <span class="o">*=</span> <span class="n">seq</span> <span class="c"># oh, we&#39;re just finding the product of a sequence</span>
</pre></div></p>
<p>GUILTY! In this case reduce only serves to dramatically reduce(geddit) the amount of code written at the expense of any clarity. This is a simple example and is, admittedly, quite understandable and simple for anyone who has used reduce  (or fold in another language). However, as code grows in complexity, loops are almost always more clear. So, in the case of <code>reduce v. Python</code>, the judge finds the defendant not only guilty of obfuscation and lack of necessity, but also guilty of pure evil. For that, reduce meets the gallows (as it essentially has in Python 3).</p>
<h3>Syllabus (AKA tl;dr)</h3>
<p><code>lambda</code> is only acceptable in a few restricted situations. <code>map</code>, <code>filter</code>, and <code>reduce</code> need to leave the Python language because they are unnecessary and they quickly grow unwieldy and unreadable as their complexity increases.</p>
<p>I accept functional programming as a good idea in general (what would we do without closures and first-class functions, after all), but some parts of Python are relics of Lisp hackers before us and don't really fit in with the language philosophy. Because of this, I'll take Guido's side: I don't like most of the functional programming stuff mixed into Python's global namespace and syntax. I don't mind having a module for it (<code>functools</code> is useful, and when you import it it's a clear statement of intent), in fact, I happen to like that module. But in general, higher-order functions and lambdas need to be relegated to a lower place in the language.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html" xml:base="http://www.rafekettler.com/blog/2011/01/17/magic-method-monday-mixed-mode-arithmetic"><![CDATA[<p>This may very well be the last magic methods blog post, and it's fitting that I'll be addressing a method that I initially overlooked.</p>
<p>Python would be very hard to use without mixed-mode arithmetic: imagine what Python would be like if a type-conversion was necessary to add an integer to a float. In order to make our classes behave the same way, we can define a <code>__coerce__</code> method.</p>
<p><code>__coerce__</code></p>
<p>Method to implement mixed mode arithmetic. Takes arguments <code>self</code> and <code>other</code>. Should return <code>None</code> if type conversion is impossible. Otherwise, it should return a pair (2-tuple) of self and other, manipulated to have the same type.</p>
<p>That's all for now; it seems that I'll have to find another weekly series to tackle. Keep watching the magic methods guide <a href="http://www.rafekettler.com/magicmethods.html">here</a>.</p>]]></content>

Thus, I'm running out of magic methods to work with. Here we head back to a few magic methods that I ignored (or forgot): <code>__unicode__</code> and <code>__nonzero__</code>.</p>
<p><code>__unicode__</code></p>
<p>Takes argument self. It returns a unicode string representation of the instance.</p>
<p><code>__nonzero__</code></p>
<p>Takes argument self and returns a boolean value, <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>. This method gets called when the <code>bool()</code> builtin is called on an instance, e.g.</p>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Magic Method Monday: Context Managers]]></summary>
    <content type="html" xml:base="http://www.rafekettler.com/blog/2011/01/03/magic-method-monday-context-managers"><![CDATA[<p>In Python 2.5, a new keyword was introduced in Python along with a new method for code reuse, the <code>with</code> statement. The concept of context managers was hardly new in Python (it was implemented before as a part of the library, I believe), but not until <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0343/">PEP 343</a> was accepted did it achieve status as a first class language construct. Usage for the <code>with</code> statement is simple:</p>
<div class="pygments_tango"><pre><span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">A</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="c"># do something</span>
</pre></div>

<p>You're probably wondering what the point of all of this is. It might look innocuous at first, but there's some magic going on behind the scenes (and, as always with Python, you can take control of that magic for yourself).</p>
<p><code>__enter__</code></p>
<p>Defines what the context manager (the <code>with</code> statement) should do at the beginning of the block. It takes the argument <code>self</code>. Whatever it returns get bound to the <em>target</em> in the <code>with</code> statement (the name after <code>as</code>), so you could in fact use <code>__enter__</code> to create a completely new object altogether (if you'd like).</p>
<p><code>__exit__</code></p>
<p>Gets loaded at the start of the block and executed after the block. It can commonly be used to handle exceptions, perform cleanup (closing a file or connection), or do something that is always done immediately after we're finished with an object. Unlike <code>__enter__</code>, <code>__exit__</code> takes several arguments, <code>self</code>, <code>exception_type</code>, <code>exception_value</code>, and <code>traceback</code>. If there's no exception, the last 3 arguments will be <code>None</code>. Otherwise, you can either choose to handle the exception or let it get handled by the user; if you want to handle it, make sure <code>__exit__</code> returns <code>True</code> after all is said and done. Otherwise, let the exception happen.</p>]]></content>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Avoiding overloading constructors in Scala]]></summary>
    <content type="html" xml:base="http://www.rafekettler.com/blog/2010/12/23/avoiding-overloading-constructors-in-scala"><![CDATA[<p>I'm working my way through <a href="http://www.artima.com/shop/programming_in_scala">Programming in Scala, 1st edition</a>. I didn't know there was a second edition, but when I perused the list of Scala 2.8-specific additions that it had, one really caught my eye: "Named and default parameters".</p>
<p>This really hits close to my heart. One of my favorite things about Python was the ability to use named parameters, which greatly simplifies using APIs and the standard library, and default arguments, which provides users with fine-tuned control when they need it and common options when they don't. It's really a great feature, and the best part about it is that it completely eliminates the need for overloading methods and functions.</p>
<p>In Scala, the thing that I liked the most was how concisely you could define a constructor:</p>
<div class="pygments_tango"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">MyClass</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">paramA</span><span class="k">:</span> <span class="kt">Int</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">paramB</span><span class="k">:</span> <span class="kt">Int</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
  <span class="c1">// Your constructor code here...</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>How great is that? No stupid <code>def MyClass(paramA: Int, paramB: Int) = ...</code>, just good old fashioned, to-the-point construction. It also makes code more readable that way, because you can learn a lot about a class just by reading its declaration stub (for example, that it takes 2 parameters in construction, 2 Ints). However, when you want to define alternate constructors, things go to hell with overloading:</p>
<div class="pygments_tango"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">MyClass</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">paramA</span><span class="k">:</span> <span class="kt">Int</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">paramB</span><span class="k">:</span> <span class="kt">Int</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
  <span class="c1">// Your constructor code here...</span>

<p><span class="k">def</span> <span class="k">this</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">paramA</span><span class="k">:</span> <span class="kt">Int</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="k">=</span> <span class="k">this</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">paramA</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="c1">//Why is this necessary?</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</pre></div></p>
<p>Perfectly beautiful class definition ruined by an ugly this. But when I found out named and default parameters were in Scala 2.8, I had to try it with constructors. Turns out, it works! Code beautified and simplified, and now the class declaration stub is more informative than ever.</p>
<p>$$code(lang=scala)
class MyClass(paramA: Int, paramB: Int = 1) {
  // Your constructor code here...
}</p>
<p>I think Scala and I are going to like each other...</p>]]></content>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Magic Method Monday: Custom Numeric Types]]></summary>
    <content type="html" xml:base="http://www.rafekettler.com/blog/2010/12/20/magic-method-monday-custom-numeric-types"><![CDATA[<p>I've been dreading doing this MMM for a while, but it's worth it. Python magic methods can do just about anything; make sequences that behave like language constructs, make descriptors, even make comparisons using operators like <code>==</code>. Most of you have already figured out that there's a way to make classes defined by the programmer feel and work like basic numeric types. It just so happens that there's about 40 magic methods for this. Here we go:</p>
<table>
<tr><td><strong>Magic Method</strong></td><td><strong>Arguments</strong></td><td><strong>Description</strong></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>__add__</code></td><td>self, other</td><td>Emulates addition(<code>self + other</code>)</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>__sub__</code></td><td>self, other</td><td>Emulates subtraction (<code>self - other</code>)</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>__mul__</code></td><td>self, other</td><td>Emulates multiplication (<code>self * other</code>)</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>__floordiv__</code></td><td>self, other</td><td>Emulates integer division (<code>self // other</code>)</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>__div__</code></td><td>self, other</td><td>Emulates division (<code>self / other</code>)</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>__truediv__</code></td><td>self, other</td><td>Emulates division (<code>self / other</code>) when <code>from __future__ import division</code> is in effect</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>__mod__</code></td><td>self, other</td><td>Emulates modulo (<code>self % other</code>)</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>__divmod__</code></td><td>self, other</td><td>Emulates long division (<code>divmod(self, other)</code>)</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>__pow__</code></td><td>self, other</td><td>Emulates exponent (<code>self**other</code>)</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>__lshift__</code></td><td>self, other</td><td>Emulates left bitwise shift (<code>self << other</code>)</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>__rshift__</code></td><td>self, other</td><td>Emulates right bitwise shift (<code>self >> other</code>)</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>__and__</code></td><td>self, other</td><td>Emulates bitwise and (<code>self & other</code>)</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>__or__</code></td><td>self, other</td><td>Emulates bitwise or (<code>self | other</code>)</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>__xor__</code></td><td>self, other</td><td>Emulates bitwise xor (<code>self ^ other</code>)</td></tr>
</table>

<p>That's it for the "normal" operators. But there's more; each one of these has a version for a reflected operand (e.g. <code>x - my_class</code>, where the primary operand is <code>x</code>, not <code>my_instance</code>). These only get called when <code>x</code> does not support the attempted operation and <code>x</code> and <code>my_instance</code> are of different types.</p>
<table>
<tr><td><strong>Magic Method</strong></td><td><strong>Arguments</strong></td><td><strong>Description</strong></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>__radd__</code></td><td>self, other</td><td>Emulates reflected addition(<code>other + self</code>)</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>__rsub__</code></td><td>self, other</td><td>Emulates reflected subtraction (<code>other - self</code>)</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>__rmul__</code></td><td>self, other</td><td>Emulates reflected multiplication (<code>other * self</code>)</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>__rfloordiv__</code></td><td>self, other</td><td>Emulates reflected integer division (<code>other // self</code>)</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>__rdiv__</code></td><td>self, other</td><td>Emulates reflected division (<code>other / self</code>)</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>__rtruediv__</code></td><td>self, other</td><td>Emulates reflected division (<code>other / self</code>) when <code>from __future__ import division</code> is in effect</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>__rmod__</code></td><td>self, other</td><td>Emulates reflected modulo (<code>other % self</code>)</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>__rdivmod__</code></td><td>self, other</td><td>Emulates reflected long division (<code>divmod(other, self)</code>)</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>__rpow__</code></td><td>self, other</td><td>Emulates reflected exponent (<code>other**self</code>)</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>__rlshift__</code></td><td>self, other</td><td>Emulates reflected left bitwise shift (<code>other << self</code>)</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>__rrshift__</code></td><td>self, other</td><td>Emulates reflected right bitwise shift (<code>other >> self</code>)</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>__rand__</code></td><td>self, other</td><td>Emulates reflected bitwise and (<code>other & self</code>)</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>__ror__</code></td><td>self, other</td><td>Emulates reflected bitwise or (<code>other | self</code>)</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>__rxor__</code></td><td>self, other</td><td>Emulates reflected bitwise xor (<code>other ^ self</code>)</td></tr>
</table>

<p>And then, there's more. Each normal magic method has a version for augmented assignment (e.g. <code>my_instance += x</code>).</p>
<table>
<tr><td><strong>Magic Method</strong></td><td><strong>Arguments</strong></td><td><strong>Description</strong></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>__iadd__</code></td><td>self, other</td><td>Emulates augmented assignment with addition(<code>self += other</code>)</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>__isub__</code></td><td>self, other</td><td>Emulates augmented assignment with subtraction (<code>self -= other</code>)</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>__imul__</code></td><td>self, other</td><td>Emulates augmented assignment with multiplication (<code>self *= other</code>)</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>__ifloordiv__</code></td><td>self, other</td><td>Emulates augmented assignment with integer division (<code>self //= other</code>)</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>__idiv__</code></td><td>self, other</td><td>Emulates augmented assignment with division (<code>self /= other</code>)</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>__itruediv__</code></td><td>self, other</td><td>Emulates augmented assignment with division (<code>self /= other</code>) when <code>from __future__ import division</code> is in effect</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>__imod__</code></td><td>self, other</td><td>Emulates augmented assignment with modulo (<code>self %= other</code>)</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>__ipow__</code></td><td>self, other</td><td>Emulates augmented assignment with exponent (<code>self **= other</code>)</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>__ilshift__</code></td><td>self, other</td><td>Emulates augmented assignment with left bitwise shift (<code>self <<= other</code>)</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>__irshift__</code></td><td>self, other</td><td>Emulates augmented assignment with right bitwise shift (<code>self >>= other</code>)</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>__iand__</code></td><td>self, other</td><td>Emulates augmented assignment with bitwise and (<code>self &= other</code>)</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>__ior__</code></td><td>self, other</td><td>Emulates augmented assignment with bitwise or (<code>self |= other</code>)</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>__ixor__</code></td><td>self, other</td><td>Emulates augmented assignment with bitwise xor (<code>self ^= other</code>)</td></tr>
</table>

<p>You thought it was over? It's not. We still need unary arithmetic operators.</p>
<table>
<tr><td><strong>Magic Method</strong></td><td><strong>Arguments</strong></td><td><strong>Description</strong></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>__pos__</code></td><td>self</td><td>Emulates unary positive(<code>+self</code>)</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>__neg__</code></td><td>self</td><td>Emulates negation<code>-self</code>)</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>__abs__</code></td><td>self</td><td>Emulates absolute value(<code>abs(self)</code>)</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>__invert__</code></td><td>self</td><td>Emulates inversion(<code>~self</code>)</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Now, we have to be able to change types:</p>
<table>
<tr><td><strong>Magic Method</strong></td><td><strong>Arguments</strong></td><td><strong>Description</strong></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>__float__</code></td><td>self</td><td>Converts to float(<code>float(self)</code>)</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>__int__</code></td><td>self</td><td>Converts to int(<code>int(self)</code>)</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>__long__</code></td><td>self</td><td>Converts to long(<code>long(self)</code>)</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>__complex__</code></td><td>self</td><td>Converts to complex(<code>complex(self)</code>)</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>__oct__</code></td><td>self</td><td>Converts to octal(<code>oct(self)</code>)</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>__hex__</code></td><td>self</td><td>Converts to hexadecimal(<code>hex(self)</code>)</td></tr>
</table>

<p>That's basically it. I don't want to implement a class to demonstrate any of this 1.) because it's fairly self explanatory and 2.) that would be one monster of a class.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html" xml:base="http://www.rafekettler.com/blog/2010/12/17/magic-methods-sequences-continued"><![CDATA[<p>It came to my attention that I left out a few magic methods when I covered sequences a few months ago. I know it's not Monday, but I don't feel like waiting to tackle this, and I have a free minute now.</p>
<p><code>__reversed__</code></p>
<p><code>__reversed</code> defines behavior for when you call <code>reversed()</code> on your sequence. Takes self.</p>
<p><code>__contains__</code></p>
<p><code>__contains</code> defines behavior for when we use <code>in</code> with a custom sequence, e.g. <code>x in y</code> or <code>x not in y</code>. It takes arguments self and item to test for membership. Note that this doesn't need to be defined for <code>in</code> to work with a custom sequence; the default behavior for <code>x in y</code> is to iterate over y and return True if any of the values in y are x.</p>
<p>That's all for today, happy holidays everyone.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html" xml:base="http://www.rafekettler.com/blog/2010/12/15/why-php-throws-me"><![CDATA[<p>After learning PHP for a few weeks, it was very disorienting. It had no right to be -- I'm familiar with C-style syntax and I program in dynamically typed, interpreted languages all the time (though the $ sigils before variables make me a bit dizzy). All the syntax -- functions, classes, control flow -- either remind me of C, Java, or Python. The thing that throws most people -- the <em>wild</em> inconsistency in naming conventions -- confuses me a bit, but I've basically gotten over it. Even the lack of a real sense of scope (I don't have to do anything to use a MySQL function, I just use it, same with the rest of the standard library, AFAIK) was possible to overcome.</p>
<p>I figured out what really bothers me about it --  it subverts my expectations for programming style. I'm used to doing some things with objects and others procedurally. PHP doesn't -- it seems like many things are procedural when they have no right to be, and it makes the language look like a mess.</p>
<p>I think the design choice that Python really got right (along with a few other languages) is making some basic types as well as much of the standard library object-oriented. Where Python has list methods, PHP has 50+ functions that operate on arrays procedurally. What is <code>last_elem = some_list.pop()</code> in Python becomes <code>$last_elem = array_pop($some_list)</code> in PHP. My preference towards the Python style is probably just my upbringing -- but I don't see why, in a dynamically-typed language, I have to constantly type <code>array_this()</code> and <code>array_that()</code> to operate on arrays.</p>
<p>I suppose this has its roots in PHP's heritage -- it didn't start out object-oriented, so in an attempt to not break compatibility, the procedural relics were kept. But even as much as I admonish "There's More Than One Way To Do It", you'd think by now they'd have at least made it so you could operate on strings and arrays using methods. This is why I like where PHP 5 is going (or has been going) -- things that for really no good reason used to be procedural are now object-oriented. When working with the <code>mysql</code> extension, I feel like I'm programming in C, passing around an object from function to function (except in some cases, this can be implicit, which also irks me). But <code>mysqli</code> fixes that, making things, at least in my opinion, far more natural (and less cluttered with <code>mysql_this()</code> and <code>mysql_that()</code>). Take these examples:</p>
<div class="pygments_tango"><pre><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>

<p><span class="c1">// Connecting to a MySQL DB the procedural way</span>
<span class="nv">$host</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;somehost&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="nv">$user</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;user&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="nv">$pass</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;password&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="nv">$db</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;somedb&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span></p>
<p><span class="nv">$connection</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">mysql_connect</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$host</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nv">$user</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nv">$pass</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="nb">mysql_select_db</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$db</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">// With no second argument, PHP just infers that I&#39;m using $connection</span>
<span class="nv">$result</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">mysql_query</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;SELECT * FROM symbols&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">// again, PHP just assumes it&#39;s $connection</span>
<span class="cm">/<em> Now I pass $result to a billion functions to do something with it. All in all, it&#39;s really inconsistent</span>
<span class="cm">and counter intuitive for anyone who realizes that connections are best represented as objects </em>/</span></p>
<p><span class="nb">mysql_close</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$connection</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">// The last nail in the coffin</span></p>
<p><span class="cp">?&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
</pre></div></p>
<p>Compare this to using <code>mysqli</code>:</p>
<?php
// Using a MySQL DB, the OO way

<p>$connection = new mysqli($host, $user, $pass, $db); // Simple object construction
$result = $connection-&gt;query('SELECT * FROM SYMBOLS');
/<em> Now we use $result as an object, too! How about that. No ambiguity, no repetition, just
beautiful, object-oriented code. </em>/
$connection-&gt;close();
?&gt;
$$/code</p>
<p>I hope that at some point PHP breaks compatibility to do what <code>mysqli</code> did to <code>mysql</code> for the rest of the language. Some things deserve to be objects, and a lot of the problems of PHP can be fixed in the process (inconsistent naming, excessive verbosity, ambiguity). Maybe I'm just trying to code Python in PHP, but that wouldn't be so bad, would it?</p>]]></content>
