<p>At rafekettler.com, I write about interesting things that I encounter in programming, technology, and the rest of the world. Some articles may be tutorial in nature, others expository, and some editorial. Mainly, I just try to share things that I encounter that I feel need sharing.</p>

<p>I do most of my coding in Python and C. I use PHP as well, but I have to say it's less than enjoyable. I'm actively involved in a few projects/sites, including <a href="http://bugs.python.org">fixing bugs in Python</a>, <a href="http://www.rafekettler.com/magicmethods.html">the Python Magic Methods Guide</a>, and <a href="http://www.stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a>. I also read a few newsgroups: comp.lang.python, comp.lang.c, comp.emacs, and a few others (I don't post often, though), and I sometimes post on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming">the programming subreddit</a>.</p>

<p>At the moment, I'm preparing to enter computer science school. I'm still not quite sure what I want to do going forward, but I know programming will be a big part of that.</p>

<p>My topics of interest include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Functional programming</li>
<li>Optimization and efficiency</li>
<li>Source/version control (I'm partial to git)</li>
<li>Interesting and unusual syntax (e.g. decorators in Python)</li>
</ul>

<p>Tools that I use (and enjoy):</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a></li>
<li><a href="www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">GNU Emacs</a></li>
<li>C and <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org">gcc</a></li>
<li>Linux (Fedora is my distro of choice)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.git-scm.com">git</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.github.com">GitHub</a> -- you can view my projects and profile <a href="http://www.github.com/RafeKettler">here</a></li>
<li>markdown (blog, Magic Methods Guide, reddit, Stack Overflow, github, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p>I try to update the site weekly (or more often if I can), but some weeks may be more or less busy depending on what I'm doing. I have plenty of free time, so if you need someone to contribute to a project (and it's either in Python, C, or in an environment with enough tolerance for error), I'd be happy and honored to help. I benefit immensely on a day to day basis from open-source software, and the least I can do is give back.</p>

<p>If you want to get in touch, find me on Facebook, Github, or Skype (be sure to mention programming or something, or else I'll surely ignore any requests), or leave a comment.</p>
